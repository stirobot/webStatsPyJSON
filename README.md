# webStatsPyJSON
A JSON "software sensor" for pinging and other stuff that uses Flask and other fun stuff

This uses:
Python,
the Flask framework, and
someone else's callback (jsonp) code

It is sample code to show how this sort of thing works.

The json called and created with this dynamically can be read and used by things like freeboard.io

It only works on windows, but you can figure out how to change subprocess and the parsing to work with anything.
